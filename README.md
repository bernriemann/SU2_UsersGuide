# SU2_UsersGuide

This guide is written for **SU2: the Open-Source CFD Code**, and it's entirely based on official docs from website https://su2code.github.io/ (it's literally a copy-and-paste of instructions contained in the site). *All rights belong to their respective owners.*

The guide is written in LaTex. In this repo there are two folders: 
- Figures, that contains all the images that are described in the main code;
- Files, in which there are four different examples of square mesh that are mentioned in the source code.

This repo also contains a pdf-format **SU2_UsersGuide**, ready to use instead of compiling the LaTex code.
